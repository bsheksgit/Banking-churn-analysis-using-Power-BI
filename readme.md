This is a PowerBI project for churn analysis of a bank.
CSV file was imported and transformed using power query editor.
First all the null values were removed, then the coloumns for customer ID and serial number were removed since they wouldn't be useful in the analysis.
New columns with the names "Age group" and "Tenure Range" are created to add the values into bins of various interval. These cloumns are of text type.
This data is now loaded for analysis.
The analysis consists of three pages of customer analysis and two pages of churn analysis.
Customers are analysed based on their age, gender and credit card ownership.
Chrun analysis is done based on age, gender, age group, tenure and geography.
Finally a navigation page is created to link all the reports. Each button takes to the respective report.[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[Dyou to the respective report.
